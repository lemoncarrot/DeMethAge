Hey Viewer!

This is all the code I used for my 2024 Science and Engineering Fair of Houston Poster! Feel free to reach out to me @ kchen020202@gmail.com for access to the processed datasets so you can jump into the analyses! 

*All code is in R except "model_1_segment" and "model_2_segment" (Python)

Note: FlowSorted.BloodExtended.EPIC requires a signed license through and academic institution.
